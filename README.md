## Overview of the Project

### Project: CREATING A STATIC WEBSITE WITH GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE

### Objective

The objective of this project is to create and deploy a static website using Google Cloud Storage. The project involves building a simple website using HTML and CSS and then hosting it on Google Cloud Storage to make it publicly accessible. This exercise aims to demonstrate the process of using cloud services for website hosting, ensuring efficient, scalable, and cost-effective web deployment. The project also serves as a practical example of how to leverage cloud infrastructure for static content delivery.

### Key Activities

-**Website Development**: Design and develop a simple static website using HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT

-**Google Cloud Setup**: Create a Google Cloud account and set up a new project.

-**Configure the Storage Bucket**: Upload the website files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) to the Google Cloud Storage bucket.

-**Website Deployment**: Deploy the static website to the Google Cloud Storage bucket.

### Technology Used

-**Google Cloud Storage**: Utilized as the hosting platform for deploying the static website.

-**Google Cloud Console**: The web interface used to manage Google Cloud services, including creating and configuring storage buckets.

-**Google Cloud Storage API**: Used to interact programmatically with Google Cloud Storage, including managing bucket configurations and file uploads.

-**Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Used for interacting with Git and Google Cloud SDK (optional) for command-line operations.

### Key Insights
